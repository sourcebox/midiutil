# midiutil

## Synopsis

midiutil is a command line tool written in Python for debugging and testing MIDI devices.
It can send specific data to MIDI devices known by the host, either virtual, via USB directly or a dedicated MIDI interface. It also allows
to monitor incoming data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.3 or later
- [python-rtmidi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-rtmidi/)

midiutil was mainly developed and tested on Linux and macOS but should also work on Windows.

## Quick Start

    midiutil.py -h

Shows available options.

    midiutil.py -l

Lists available MIDI devices, separated by inputs and outputs.
Each device has an ID which has to be used to select the device
when transmitting data.

Instead of a numerical ID, you can use the case-insensitive device name or a part of it.

### Sending MIDI data

    midiutil.py -d ID -w DATA [DATA ...]

Sends data to a device.

Example:

    midiutil.py -d 2 -w 0x90 60 127
    midiutil.py -d mysynth -w 0x90 60 127

In the example above, a Note On message on MIDI channel 1 with note number 60
and a velocity of 127 is sent to output device id 2.
Numbers prefixed with 0x are interpreted as hex values.

### Monitoring MIDI data

    midiutil.py -d ID -r [-x]

Listens to data from a device and displays it.

Example:

    midiutil.py -d 2 -r
    midiutil.py -d mysynth -r

Shows incoming messages from input device id 2.

To display data as hex values, add the `-x` switch to the command:

    midiutil.py -d 2 -x

Use `Ctrl-C` to abort monitoring and return to the command prompt.
